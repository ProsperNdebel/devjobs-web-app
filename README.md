## Overview

this is an advanced html, css and vanilla javascript project
in this project

- I implement manipulating the localstorage API to store themes and store transfer html strings generated from one page to another
- I also implement an **advanced search** feature that uses complex string methods and regular expressions to achive that
- I also use a functional style of programming that is used by frameworks like react, Vue and Angular behind the scenes when creating DOM elements to insert into the DOM(for things like search results and displaying the the detail page)

### The challenge

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size (this is responsiveness)
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site ()
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
